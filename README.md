# ML-Powered API Monitoring Homelab

A self-hosted cloud infrastructure running on bare metal + Oracle Cloud,
featuring real-time ML anomaly detection for APIs.

##  Architecture
```
Physical Server (Ubuntu 24.04)     Oracle Cloud (Free Tier)
├── Nextcloud (File Storage)        ├── Backup Storage
├── Vaultwarden (Passwords)         └── Overflow APIs
├── ML Anomaly Detector
├── Prometheus + Grafana + Loki
├── FastAPI (monitored APIs)
└── Cloudflare Tunnel (HTTPS)
```

##  ML Anomaly Detection

- Algorithm: Isolation Forest (unsupervised learning)
- Detects: unusual error rates, response time spikes, traffic anomalies
- Training: continuous rolling window (last 1000 requests)
- Features: response time, status code, payload size, hour of day

## Live Demo

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| File Cloud | https://cloud.cloudalex.me |
| API | https://api.cloudalex.me/docs |
| Monitoring | https://monitor.cloudalex.me |

## Security

- SSH key authentication only
- UFW firewall 
- Fail2ban 
- Cloudflare Tunnel
- SSL/TLS via Cloudflare

## Services

### Nextcloud
Self-hosted Google Drive alternative with mobile sync,
photo backup, calendar and contacts sync.

### Vaultwarden
Self-hosted Bitwarden-compatible password manager.
Zero-knowledge encryption, accessible from any device.

### ML API Monitoring
Real-time anomaly detection system that:
- Intercepts every API request via FastAPI middleware
- Extracts features (latency, status, payload size)
- Trains Isolation Forest model continuously
- Flags anomalous requests in real time
- Visualizes everything in Grafana dashboards

### Observability Stack
- Prometheus scrapes metrics every 15 seconds
- Loki aggregates logs from all containers
- Grafana dashboards show request rates, anomalies, latency
